Drop an image named `press-to-start.png` or `press-to-start.svg` in this folder to use it as the "Press to Start" button graphic.

Recommended:
- Filename: `press-to-start.png` or `press-to-start.svg`
- Size: ~600x180 or aspect ratio close to 3:1 for consistent button sizing
- Use transparent background for PNG/SVG so the glow shows through.

Behavior:
- The Preloader will use this image as the button background if present.
- If the file is missing the component will fall back to the styled text button.

Path: `src/assets/ui/press-to-start.png` (or `.svg`)
